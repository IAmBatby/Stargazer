# SCP:CB Dungeon Generation for Lethal Company
A mod for Lethal Company that adds the SCP facility as a potential dungeon to Titan. Uses assets from SCP: Containment Breach, plus some extra assets made by DisabledWhales.

# Unity Asset Package info
The asset package provided is designed to be used in a decompiled version of Lethal Company to develop on; however no assets or code from the game are contained in the package (some assets such as the fire exit are remade, others such as scripted exit doors are swapped out at runtime)
